                                    Since from my childhood I was always a child that is interested in how devices worked from radio to television I opened my first radio at an age of 5 years old I will be truthful it ended badly for the radio I guess that was the start of something big. After that incident I learned that devices most be handle with care few year later I had access to first my first computer at an age of 7 years old by that time I was only interested in game.

                                    One night the computer crashed it was running windows XP the windows to hate I had the copy of the windows disk, so the only solution I had was to try to boot it for myself but this time was a successful story windows was installed since that day I have installed my version of window in my computers.

                                    After few years later when I was age 15 years old I started to ask myself how website and application work I did some research but by that time I did not have much time because I used to be a soccer player I was always in the pitch training during the week and playing tournaments in weekends. That’s when I come I cross a language called C++ and my brother friend give me a copy of Visual Studio 2013 Pro he was studying Computer Science that means my first hello world application was build using C++.

                                <p class="lead small">
                                    Few year later I had a major ACL surgery at an age of 17 years old so I had 3 months of recovery at home that was that perfect time to practice programming C++ was starting to get hard when I started to use SDL library some I did some research again. Many blog recommended HTML, CSS and JavaScript but for me it felt wrong building static website I needed to build real application and I added PHP and MySQL. Honestly those blogs were correct learning all those technologies at the same time it takes years fully understand them.

                                    One year and few months later I felt ready to start developing for the real world I build a small showcase project called OrangeFarmNews and went to a local internet café that’s where I got my first real world project called MoneyWiseLoans it was a local loan broker, after some time I started to learn frameworks such as Laravel, Angular and NodeJs even today my mean focus is in NodeJs that’s my story.
